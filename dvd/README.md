# Bouncing DVD Logo Screensaver
This is the well-known bouncy screen saver thing. It's a simple script that picks a random direction from a list of functions, and then depending on current vector and point of collision will adjust to the logical next vector.

## But why??
I've been making games with Godo for a few months now and love it, but I thought it would be nice to give this a shot with Pygame. There are a few reasons for this:

- Pygame doesn't exactly hold your hand like Godot does--there's a lot of things you have to handle yourself (gameclock, rendering)
- I've been wanting to program more in Python. GDScript is awesome, fun to use, and similar to Python (and there's type safety!!), but I wanted to program more in Python while making games, which is something I love to do.
- I have been wanting to learn Pygame for a long time now so I figured something simple like this would be a good first project to get a handle on things.

I also decided to do this because it's instantly recognizable and understandable. It's easy to see when something goes wrong visually and thus is simpler to debug.

## Room for improvement
This is just a little rough draft to get my hands dirty. Now that I'm getting a handle on some of the major moving pieces here, I think it would be fun to:

- Change logo color on collision
- Do something funny when it hits a corner

This program is free to use, download, and manipulate in any way the user sees fit. Have fun : - )
