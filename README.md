# Pygame Games

I've dabbled in game development and I'd like to pursue it as a hobby. I enjoy Godot and the Python-esque GDScript, but I find a lot of joy in programming games without an engine at all. 

## Current Games

So far, I've just made a couple of games:

- DVD Screen Saver
- Pong

The first one isn't exactly a game, but it is made with Pygame, so I'll count it. I started learning Pygame using the starter code available on Pygame's documentation page, and I thought I could extend it by making the bouncy DVD logo screensaver. It was not too difficult and satisfying to finish.

The second game here so far is my own implementation of Pong. I figured my first video game should be *the* first video game. It seemed poetic and it was pretty hard going in blind. I'm sure I'll look back at this code in a year and faceplant, but I'm happy I got it (mostly) working. Next step is to actually calculate vectors to get some better bounces. I currently need to fix the game over screen so that the user is prompted to play again. I've got some ideas for CPU difficulty settings and I'm excited to implement them. Unfortunately, as I'm writing this, I'm leaving for some military training, so it might be difficult to escape to pong.

## Planned Projects

I've followed a tutorial for Snake, but there were a lot of issues with it. Lots of global variables (I'm typically okay with that depending on the scope, but I'm trying to get a lot better at OOP, so I'd like to avoid it for now), and the speed of the snake was determined by the FRAME RATE. That is pretty hacky. So I'd like to make my own.

I'd also like to make a simple RPG to practice some heavier data persistence and YML or JSON based story progression. Maybe some simplified Final Fantasy or Pokemon clone (most likely the former--I don't want to get sued for violating Nintendo's all-seeing copyright laws!). I'd also like to try my hand at a platformer. I know a little bit of computational physics from some of my modeling and simulation work, and I'm curious to see how that carries over to making a little physics engine.
